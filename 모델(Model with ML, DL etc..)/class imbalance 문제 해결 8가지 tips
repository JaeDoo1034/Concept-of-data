3) A Gentle Introduction to Threshold-Moving for Imbalanced Classification
* After completing this tutorial, you will know:

- The default threshold for interpreting probabilities to class labels is 0.5, and tuning this hyperparameter is called threshold moving.
- How to calculate the optimal threshold for the ROC Curve and Precision-Recall Curve directly.
- How to manually search threshold values for a chosen model and model evaluation metric.
